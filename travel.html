        <p>New York City is one of my favorite place, traveling around the largest metropolis in the United States. It's been known popular for tourism, for instance, amazaing attractions like museums, parks, zoos, and shops around Manhattan. Also, New York City was known have wonderful architecture styles, like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, Grand Central Terminal, and the World Trade Center complex. New York is known to have incredible food, and a very kind of place where there are so many concerts on the given evening. Somehow for me, it was best known in New York City to gain traveling experiences around Summer and Winter. </p>
